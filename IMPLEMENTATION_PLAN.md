## Notes

- This plan is iterative - each phase should result in a functional improvement
- Metal integration should be incremental, not blocking basic functionality
- User testing should begin after Milestone 1
- Performance benchmarking should start in Phase 4
- Swift 6.2 strict concurrency mode requires careful actor isolation
